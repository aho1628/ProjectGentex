## Inspiration
I programmed Gentex for a math project on the application of Markov Chains in computer science. While brainstorming on ideas for my math project, I realized that I had an essay due the next day. What if I could come up with a program that would just take in some notes and write an essay for me?  That was when Gentex was born!

## What it does
Gentex is your solution for writing quick essays on any given topics. Given either a set of notes on a certain topic or even another essay, Gentex will randomly generate a grammatically correct essay with a specified amount of sentences.

## How I built it
First, I programmed Gentex to have a database of grammar rules that it could follow. Next, I wrote a function that would allow Gentex to break down the notes into separate strings of different lengths and tag them based on parts of speech so that they could be input into the grammar rules to make sentences. Then, I coded a function that would link everything together to create an essay. Finally, I made use of Microsoft Word's editor to check the generated essay and fix any outstanding grammatical errors. 

## Challenges I ran into
A challenge that I ran into was how to ensure that all sentences were grammatically correct. I fixed this by incorporating Microsoft Word's editor, which helped reduce the number of grammar errors within the essay significantly.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of how efficient and quick my program worked because I refined the algorithm behind the text generator.

## What I learned
I learned how Markov Chains are important when generating text. In addition, I had a blast learning how to use other applications to improve the efficiency of my program.

## What's next for Gentex
In the future, I want to further improve Gentex's writing capabilities to different forms of writing such as poems and possibly even lyrics for songs. I would also like to make Gentex into an app so that it will be more accessible and easier to use.
